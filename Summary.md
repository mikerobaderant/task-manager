# Summary

## BB Web Dev Lab — Rust + Axum Implementation

### Experience Report (~60 sec)

- What was surprisingly easy?
  - The project was easy to set up. I created a prd.md file to guide the implementation.
  - Gave cursor rust documentation to help with the implementation.
  - Generated project rules and slash commands to help with the implementation.
- What was frustrating or difficult?
  - Nothing really frustrating or difficult.
- How helpful was AI with this unfamiliar stack?
  - Very helpful. The /start-app gives claude access to the server and browser. With that insight it was able to iterate without much input from me. (Fixed UI issues without much input from me.)

### Hot Take

- Would you use this language again? Why or why not?
  - Yes, but I'd still rather use .net for the DX. Rust is a great language, but the tooling is not as good as .net.
