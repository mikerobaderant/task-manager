# Summary

## BB Web Dev Lab — Rust + Axum Implementation

### What Was Built

A fully functional task manager with CRUD operations, SQLite persistence,
dark/light theme toggle, and a modern UI — exceeding the original PRD scope.

### Experience Report (~60 sec)

- **What was surprisingly easy?**
  - Project setup using a PRD to guide Explore-Plan-Execute methodology
  - Cursor + project rules + slash commands streamlined iteration
  - `/start-app` gave AI access to server + browser, enabling autonomous UI fixes

- **What was frustrating or difficult?**
  - Nothing major — the workflow handled complexity well

- **AI effectiveness with Rust?**
  - Very helpful. Minimal hallucinations, and it correctly used Axum patterns.

### Hot Take

Would use Rust again, but prefer .NET for DX. Rust's compiler is strict
but rewarding; tooling isn't quite as polished.
